# EffectPHP Development Roadmap
## PHP8 Port of Effect TS - Technical Implementation Guide

**Version**: 1.0  
**Target**: PHP 8.1+ (Fibers), PHP 8.3+ (Optimal)  
**Static Analysis**: Psalm Level 9 / PHPStan Level 9  
**Timeline**: 12 months to stable v1.0  

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap delivers **EffectPHP**, a pragmatic port of Effect TS to PHP8 that preserves Effect's core guarantees—structured concurrency, type safety, and composability—while working within PHP's language constraints. Based on extensive expert analysis, we prioritize **realistic type safety through convention + tooling** over impossible runtime guarantees, and **fiber-based structured concurrency** with explicit resource management.

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Hybrid Type Safety**: Combine PHPDoc generics with runtime validation and static analysis
2. **Adaptive Execution**: Fiber-based async with sync fallbacks for compatibility
3. **Convention-Based Variance**: Use tooling enforcement rather than runtime type checks
4. **Resource Safety**: WeakMap-based cleanup with explicit scope management
5. **Incremental Adoption**: Each module provides standalone value

## Deferred Features (Post-v1.0)

### ❌ Explicitly Excluded from v1
1. **Software Transactional Memory (STM)**: Requires atomics PHP lacks
2. **Advanced Stream Processing**: Complex, can use generators initially
3. **AI/LLM Integration**: Not core to Effect's value proposition
4. **Full HAMT Collections**: Performance optimization for later
5. **Distributed Tracing**: Production enhancement, not foundation
6. **Complex Scheduling/Cron**: Use existing PHP solutions initially
7. **File System Abstractions**: Native PHP sufficient for v1

### ⏳ Planned for v2.0
1. **Schema System**: Type-safe validation with inference
2. **Configuration Management**: Environment-aware config
3. **Metrics & Observability**: APM integration
4. **Cache Abstractions**: PSR-6/16 bridges
5. **Message Queues**: RabbitMQ, Redis integrations

---

## Technical Success Criteria

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Effect composition**: < 20% overhead vs native PHP
- **Collection operations**: < 50% overhead vs native arrays
- **Fiber context switches**: < 10μs per switch
- **Memory usage**: < 2x overhead for immutable structures

### Type Safety Goals
- **Psalm level 9** compliance across all modules
- **Zero type errors** in generated stubs
- **100% coverage** of public API with templates
- **Runtime validation** for critical paths

### Ecosystem Integration
- **PSR compliance**: 7, 11, 15 fully supported
- **Framework bridges**: Laravel, Symfony working examples
- **Migration tools**: CLI assistant for legacy code
- **Documentation**: Complete API reference + tutorials

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Fiber Resource Management**: Use explicit scopes, avoid automatic cleanup
2. **Type System Limitations**: Document constraints, provide workarounds
3. **Performance**: Benchmark continuously, optimize hot paths
4. **Community Adoption**: Start with framework bridges, focus on DX

### Contingency Plans
1. **Fiber Issues**: Fall back to sync execution, add async later
2. **Type Problems**: Reduce generic usage, increase runtime validation
3. **Performance Problems**: Simplify data structures, add C extension
4. **Adoption Issues**: Focus on specific use cases, improve documentation

## Conclusion

This roadmap delivers **EffectPHP v1.0** within 12 months, providing Effect TS's core benefits—structured concurrency, type safety, and composability—while respecting PHP8's constraints. By focusing on pragmatic solutions over theoretical purity, we create a production-ready library that enhances PHP development with Effect's proven patterns.

The key insight: **embrace PHP's strengths (PSR ecosystem, framework integration) while carefully working around its type system limitations through convention, tooling, and runtime validation**. This approach ensures EffectPHP delivers real value to the PHP community without over-promising features that current language constraints cannot guarantee.
