# Effect-PHP Core Library Notes

## Project Context and Purpose

Effect-PHP is a PHP8 port of the EffectTS library, designed to make development of resilient backend solutions easier. The primary goal is to address common challenges in PHP library development through functional programming patterns and effect systems.

## Background and Motivation

This work was initiated to help refactor two key libraries:

### InstructorPHP
- Library for extracting structured data from LLM outputs
- Complete ecosystem containing multiple packages:
  - **PolyglotPHP**: Part of the InstructorPHP ecosystem
  - **HttpClient layer**: Abstraction component within the ecosystem
  - **Schema component**: Data validation and structure definition (inferior to what EffectPHP could achieve)
  - **Config component**: Configuration management
  - **Additional packages**: Various utilities and abstractions
- Has basic abstractions similar to EffectPHP (Result monad, Pipeline/Chain, etc.)
- These abstractions are not well integrated across the ecosystem
- Lack of cohesive design reduces their potential power and effectiveness
- Struggles with validation, multi-stage processing, and data structure handling

### PolyglotPHP
- Unified LLM API working across various providers and inference/embedding APIs
- Uses HTTP client abstraction layer for ecosystem integration (Laravel, Symfony)
- Faces similar challenges as InstructorPHP

## Common Problems Being Addressed

Both InstructorPHP and PolyglotPHP struggle with:
- Validation at multiple levels
- Multi-stage processing of requests and responses across various layers:
  - HTTP layer
  - Inference layer
  - Structured output processing layer
- Streaming data handling
- Processing incomplete JSON data
- Serialization and deserialization of data structures
- Integration with various configuration sources
- Error handling and recovery
- Resource management

## Solution Approach

EffectTS design patterns and mindset promise to:
- Build better InstructorPHP and PolyglotPHP libraries
- Reduce mental burden in maintenance and extension
- Provide composable, type-safe abstractions
- Enable better error handling and resource management
- Support concurrent and parallel processing patterns

## Current Implementation Status

The core library includes:
- Effect system with various effect types (Success, Failure, Map, FlatMap, etc.)
- Runtime system with fiber-based concurrency
- Context/Layer system for dependency injection
- Schedule system for retry and timing operations
- Cause system for structured error handling
- Either and Option types for safe value handling
- Comprehensive test suite
